<h3>Ancient Japan</h3>
<hr style="width:10%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
<pre><em>Ancient Japanese people</em> hunting down the huge mammoth.
The history of the human race confirmed in the Japanese archipelago can be traced back to about 30,000 to 100,000 years ago.
About 34,000 years ago, stone tools called knife-type stone tools were brought to Japan from Northern China and were used throughout the Japanese islands. 
Then about 20,000 years ago, stone stools called microblades were brought to Japan from Siberia and were used mostly in eastern Japan. 
The microblade-based culture in eastern Japan and the knife-type stone tool-based culture in western Japan coexisted for some time.
However, before long, microblades came to be used widely in western Japan as well, 
and knife-type stone tools had gone out of use rapidly around 15,000 years ago.
Around 12,000 years ago, the ice age ended and the sea level began rising corresponding to rises in the atmospheric temperature,
separating the Japanese islands from the Asian continent.
Consequently, the life and culture of the people living in the Japanese islands changed drastically, leading to the beginning of the Jomon period, 
except for the small islands in the southeast of the main islands of Japan.</pre>

<h3>Classical Japan</h3>
<hr style="width:10%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
<pre>Japan's classical period spanned the sixth to the twelfth centuries. Unfortunately, this period is often neglected in world history textbooks. 
In time it falls after the classical eras of Greece, China, and India.
lt precedes the quite distinctive medieval period in Japan, famous for its samurai warriors, that began in the twelfth century.
But here in the classical period, we see a pattern that often recurs. 
The Japanese consciously and deliberately borrow — in this instance from China. Then they create a cultural synthesis which is uniquely Japanese.
The classical period gave birth to a refined court culture, in which many of the prominent figures were women.
One of them,Murasaki Shikibu, wrote what is today considered by many to be the world's first novel, the Tale of Genji.</pre>

<h3>Feudel Japan</h3>
<hr style="width:10%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
<pre>The first known written reference to Japan was recorded in the Chinese Book of Han in the 1st Century CE. Between the 4th and 9th Century,
Japan's many kingdoms and tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government, nominally controlled by the Emperor of Japan. 
This imperial dynasty continues to reign over Japan to this day.
In the year 794, a new imperial capital was established at Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto), marking the beginning of the Heian period, which lasted until 1185. 
Heian means "peace" in Japanese. The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical Japanese culture. There was great influence from China, including Buddhist religious practices that mixed with native Shinto beliefs.
Although the Imperial House of Japan had power on the surface, the real power was in the hands of the Fujiwara clan, a powerful aristocratic family who had intermarried with the imperial family.
Over the following centuries, the power of the emperor and the imperial court declined, passing first to great clans of civilian aristocrats, most notably the Fujiwara, 
and then to the military clans and their armies of samurai.
Heian and Feudal Japan
Samurai were the hereditary military nobility and had high prestige and special privileges such as wearing two swords. 
They cultivated the bushido codes of martial virtues, indifference to pain, unflinching loyalty, and engaged in many local battles.
The Minamoto clan emerged victorious from the Genpei War of 1180–85. After seizing power, they set up his capital in Kamakura and took the title of shogun. 
This marked the end of the Heian period and beginning of Japan's feudal era.</pre>

<h3>Early Modern Japan</h3>
<hr style="width:30%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
<pre>The 1550–60 period the <dfn>Sengoku daimyo</dfn>, who had survived the wars of the previous 100 years, 
moved into an even fiercer stage of mutual conflict. These powerful daimyo were harassed not only by each other but also by the rise of common people within their domains.
The daimyo sought to resolve their dilemma by acquiring land and people to widen their domains and, finally, by trying to seize control of the whole country. 
That, of course, required the control of Kyōto, the political centre of Japan since ancient times. Out of these bloody struggles emerged one Sengoku daimyo, 
Oda Nobunaga of Owari province (in modern Aichi prefecture), 
who succeeded in occupying the capital as the first feudal unifier.</pre>

<pre>Modern Japan:
A Very Short Introduction aims to explode the myths and explore the reality of modern Japan by considering its history, economy, politics, and culture. 
Japan is arguably today's most successful industrial economy, combining almost unprecedented affluence with social stability and apparent harmony. </pre>
